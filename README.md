Question 1). Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

#steps That a Datascientist would take to create a Machine Learning Model 
step 1: Understanding Business problem
    Meet with stakeholders at Sprint to understand the specific business goals . Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention.
    past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.
    in this scenario the problem  is to identify figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months.
step 2: Data Exploration:
    Examine the available data on past customer , including customer profiles, usage patterns, 
    billing information, and customer service interactions. Identify potential features (attributes) that might be indicative.
step 3:Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
     Handle missing data, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
     Encode categorical variables and perform any necessary transformations
step 4:Feature Engineering:
    Create new features or transform existing ones that could provide valuable insights into customer 
    behavior and potential churn. For example, calculate metrics like average monthly usage, tenure, or customer satisfaction scores.
step 5: Select a Machine Learning Algorithm:
   Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for binary classification .
  Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.
step 6:Model Training
   Train the chosen machine learning model using the training dataset. 
   The model will learn patterns and relationships in the data that are indicative of customer churn.
step 7:Model Evaluation
  Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, 
  precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. This step helps ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
step 8:Hyperparameter Tuning:
  Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. 
  This may involve techniques like grid search or random search.
step 9: Feature Importance Analysis
    Analyze the importance of different features in
    the model to understand which factors contribute most to predicting churn
step 10: Deployment
     Deploy the trained model into a production environment where it can be used to predict churn for new customers.

conclusion:
  By following these steps, you can build a machine learning model that effectively 
  predicts customer churn for Sprint, enabling the Company to take proactive measures to retain customers
